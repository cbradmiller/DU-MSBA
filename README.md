# DU-MSBA
This is a repository I created for the work I did in grad school (I just graduated - MS in Business Analytics). I would like to add my Capstone project which I did for Meta. There's no way I can upload the code or data, but a PDF of the presentation I gave is a possibility. Meta gave me permission to present it to my professors and students at the University of Denver, but I would like to double-check.
